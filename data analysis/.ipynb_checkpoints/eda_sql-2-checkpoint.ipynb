    "# Conclusion:\n",
    "- 1419 customers are expected to churn.\n",
    "- Most of the customers are only having electricity contract type and a very small number of them are having gas contract type and so, most of the customers who are expected to churn are only consuming electricity.\n",
    "- \"foosdfpfkusacimwkcsosbicdxkicaua\" channel sales have the greatest number of customers who are expected to churn.\n",
    "- Average prices was calculated for 2015 only since we have the consumption data for each of the companies in it.\n",
    "- Average net margin sarting from 2009 increased with a very huge rate.\n",
    "- Contracts that got activated in 2012 have the highest expected churn number of customers.\n",
    "- Almost 95% from customers who are expected to churn spent less than 6 years with bcg.\n"
